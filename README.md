# WiFi Profile Generator

This Python program helps you generate and save the WiFi profiles of all networks that your PC has connected to. It will gather information about the WiFi networks and save them in a readable format.

## Features
- Retrieves the WiFi profiles of all networks your PC has previously connected to.
- Generates a readable output containing information like the SSID, security type, and password (if available).
- Simple to run: just download the script and execute it.

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- `subprocess` and `os` modules (These are built-in libraries in Python and do not require installation.)

## Installation

1. **Download the Python Script**:
   Download the `wifi_password.py` file from this repository.

2. **Install Python** (if you haven't already):
   You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Download Dependencies** (Optional):
   This program does not require external libraries, as it only uses Python's built-in `subprocess` and `os` libraries.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where you downloaded `wifi_profile_generator.py`. Run the script with the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python wifi_profile_generator.py
   ```

2. **How it Works**:
   The script will scan for all the WiFi profiles your PC has connected to and display them on the screen. It may also output the WiFi passwords (if available and saved on your system).

## Output Example

Once the script is executed, it will show the WiFi profiles on your screen like this:

Wi-Fi Passwords

```
Wi-Fi Passwords

+------------------+-------------------+----------------+
| Security Type   | SSID              | Password      |
+------------------+-------------------+----------------+
| WPA2-Personal   | MyHomeWiFi        | mypassword123 |
| WPA3-Personal   | OfficeWiFi        | officepassword321 |
| WPA2-Personal   | GuestNetwork      | guestpass567  |
+------------------+-------------------+----------------+
```

## Notes
- This script only works on Windows.
- To view the passwords, your system must have them saved in the Windows credential manager.
- The script retrieves profiles using the built-in `netsh wlan show profiles` command on Windows.

## Troubleshooting
- **Permission Issues**: If you receive permission errors, try running the script with elevated privileges (Administrator) to ensure it has access to WiFi profiles.
- **No Password Found**: If no password is retrieved, it's possible that the password is not saved on your PC, or you may not have the appropriate permissions.
